According to statistics from W3techs.com CSS is used in a staggering 95.7% of all websites - and for good reason!

Although it has many alternatives, such as Datalog, Object Query Language, and XQuery, SQL remains the most popular. An important note is that it\'s recognition as a standard by ANSI doesn\'t make SQL\'s syntax uniform across all platforms.
